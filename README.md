- 👀 I'm interested in computer science, especially html, and I also like sports like soccer
- 🌱 I'm currently learning computer science, right now I'm in the higher cycle of computer science doing DAM. I have already graduated from the middle cycle of computer science
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in a company that specializes in programming with java or html, or any since I am a person who likes to learn
- 📫 To contact me you can do it with gmail, alexdaza2005@gmail.com, it is not the one I use for this git but it is the one I use daily and without problems
- 😄 Pronouns: Alex / Daza / Domi / Dazita
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like the idea of ​​learning, I am an athlete, and I combine studies with work since on weekends I work as a soccer referee, earning quite well for my age,
      I like to party but now that I have a partner I don't even play a party, and I live and cried in spain but my parents are ecuatorians 👍
